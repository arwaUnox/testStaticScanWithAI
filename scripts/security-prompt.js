   Your ONLY task is to perform a security analysis of the following **TypeScript** source file and identify concrete, code-level vulnerabilities.
  Focus strictly on these OWASP-related categories:
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
    - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
    - Broken Access Control (ex:CWE-22 ,CWE-23,CWE-35 ,CWE-284, CWE-285,etc.)
    - Cryptographic Failures (ex:CWE-330 ,CWE-310,CWE-331,CWE-336, etc.)
    - Injection Attacks (SQL, NoSQL, Command, etc.)
    - Insecure Design (ex;CWE-73,CWE-434,CWE-525,CWE-539, etc.)
    - Security Misconfiguration (ex:CWE-614 ,CWE-942,CWE-1032 ,etc.)
    - Use of Vulnerable or Outdated Components (ex:CWE-937,CWE-1035,CWE-1104, etc.)
    - Identification and Authentication Failures (ex:CWE-255, CWE-259, CWE-287,CWE-288,CWE-290,CWE-304 ,CWE-306,CWE-346,CWE-384,CWE-521, etc.)
    - Software and Data Integrity Failures (ex: CWE-345, CWE-353, CWE-426, CWE-494, CWE-502, CWE-565, CWE-784, CWE-829, CWE-830, CWE-915)
    - Security Logging and Monitoring Failures (ex: CWE-117, CWE-223, CWE-532, CWE-778 )
    - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)(CWE-918)
